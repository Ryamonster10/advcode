# Python Docs for The Advanced Coding Club

## Quick Guide for Experienced Members
- **Essential:** Create `requirements.txt` with PyPI dependencies before committing.
- **Commit Methodology:** Please commit your changes to a new branch, don't commit to master.
- **Branch Naming:** Use your “FIRST NAME-LAST NAME” as the branch name.
- **File Naming:** Main file should be named `main.py`.
- **Commit Message:** Include specific run instructions in the commit message.
- **Tools:** [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) and GitHub code spaces recommended, but not required.
- **Additional:** Reading the full guide is advised, but not mandatory.

## Initializing Branch
1. **Create a Code Space:** Follow master instructions until initializing your code space.
2. **New File Creation:** Click the 'create a new file' button (above existing files like README.md). Shortcut: Ctrl + N.
3. **File Naming:** Name it `main.py`.
4. **Coding:** The file autosaves with every keystroke.
5. **Running Your Project:** Open terminal (click antenna icon > terminal). Type `python3 main.py` to run.

## Adding Dependencies
1. **Terminal Access:** Open terminal (click antenna icon > terminal).
2. **Create `requirements.txt`:** Similar to `main.py`, name your file `requirements.txt`.
3. **List Dependencies:** For each dependency (e.g., `pip3 install requests`), add its name to `requirements.txt`, one per line.

## Submitting Your Project
1. **Create Your Branch:**
   - In vscode.dev, go to the Source Control section (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `g`).
   - Click on the three dots in the top right corner, then `Branch`, then `Create Branch`
   - Name the branch with your “First Name-Last Name”.

2. **Edit README.md:**
   - Use `Ctrl` + `A` to select all, then `Backspace` to clear the file.
   - Write a brief description of your project and any special installation instructions.

3. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Review the changes in each file.
   - In the Source Control section, type a commit message. For the initial commit, use “Initial Commit” or an appropriate message reflecting your changes.
   - Click the commit button (big green button).
   - Something like this will pop up:

   - Click the green `Yes` button.
   - If you forgot to type a commit message, a `COMMIT_EDITMSG` file will pop up.
   - Type your commit message on the last line of this file, and press the X to the left of the file name on the top tab list.

4. **Push to Your Branch:**
   - You will now see a green button saying `Publish Branch`. This is it! Your final chance to change anything.
   - If you're ready, click the button. If all goes well, we now have your code!

5. **Finalizing Submission:**
   - Ensure all changes are pushed to your “First Name, Last Name” branch.
   - You may see a popup asking if you'd like to make a push request, in this instance, there is no need to.
   - Congratulations, your submission is complete!
   - Thanks for joining us!
   - Feel free to ask Ryan questions throughout the competition.
